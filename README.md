# Oliver Sarfas, dot-files

Here be aliases, dot-files, and other great configuration tools

I use these in both experimental, and live environments - use with caution

## Ye hath been warned

## Installation

1. Download the repository
2. Extract the contents
3. Copy the `.bash_profile` and `aliases` files to your `$HOME` directory
4. Profit.

## Requirements
Your terminal must be a bash terminal. i.e. not Command Prompt, or Powershell. Get a real terminal like [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) or [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
